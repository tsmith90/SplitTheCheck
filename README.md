# README

 a social-networking web site that:

allows users to "vote" on whether or not a restaurant splits the check
allows users to search for restaurants in the database, in order to find out if a particular establishment does or does not split the check
restaurants are searchable by name and location
allows users to create a new listing for a restaurant if does not exist

Regarding voting: each restaurant will have "will split" votes and "won't split" votes. More "will split" votes means more users of the site have found that the restaurant will split than those who have experienced otherwise; this accounts for the fact that sometimes check-splitting is based more on the server and not the restaurant policy.
